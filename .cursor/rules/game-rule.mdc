# GameMaker Pro

- Based on [README.md](mdc:README.md)
- Encoding using GML
- Always use Traditional Chinese for communication and comments.
- Use GameMaker for game development.
- AI agent must remember the project architecture when adjusting code.
- Design should be based on the premise of the project architecture.
- Must refer to GML specifications and consult official documentation via web search when necessary.
- Make precise corrections for the problem at hand; avoid unnecessary optimizations.
- Before proposing a solution, perform a complete project search; do not make unverified assumptions.
- Primarily use "fnt_dialogue" as the standard font resource. This font should be prioritized when setting fonts.
- **GML Considerations:**
  - **Avoid using the built-in `speed` variable**: GameMaker has a built-in `speed` variable for simple movement, which can easily conflict with custom speed logic. Prioritize using `hspeed` and `vspeed` or custom speed variables.
  - **`string_format()` Argument Matching**: When using `string_format()`, ensure the number and type of arguments provided exactly match the format string (`%s`, `%d`, `%.2f`, etc.). Directly passing instance IDs or Enum values is generally safe and does not require wrapping with `string()` explicitly.
